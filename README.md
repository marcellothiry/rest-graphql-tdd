# rest-graphql-tdd
REST and GraphQL API server demo using Test-Driven Development in JavaScript

### A Note On TDD Requirement:
One purpose of this exercise is to ask you to learn TDD and to begin practicing it, as it is a practice that we hold as an ideal. See more about TDD here: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd

Please help us ensure that you were able to practice test-driven development by writing a commit after every failing test, passing test, and any refactoring. Please note that we do recognize that committing a “red” build is not ideal behavior.
